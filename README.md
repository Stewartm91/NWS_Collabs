New World Symphony + Parsons MFA DT
------

Fall 2013 and Spring 2014 saw two separate collaborations between Parsons MFA DT students in NYC and the New World Symphony based in Miami. Various selected pieces were augmented by Parsons and brought to life visually in the NWS auditorium, culminating in a performance both semesters.


Repo contains code bases for both iterations of the collaboration.

**Note:** to run OF projects, clone inside of the root OF folder, alongside addons, apps, examples, etc.

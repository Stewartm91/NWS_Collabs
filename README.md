New World Symphony + Parsons MFA DT

The Fall 2013, Spring 2014, and Spring 2015 semesters saw three separate collaborations between [Parsons MFA Design and Technology](http://amt.parsons.edu/blog/programs/design-and-technology-mfa/) students in NYC and the New World Symphony based in Miami. Various selected pieces were augmented by Parsons and brought to life visually in the NWS auditorium, culminating in a performance both semesters.

This repo contains code for [openFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc), [Arduino](http://arduino.cc), and [maxMSP](http://cycling74.com) applications developed for the collaborative performance.

**Note:** To run OF projects, clone in the root openFrameworks folder, alongside projectGenerator, addons, apps, examples, etc.
